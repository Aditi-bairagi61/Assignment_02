3,Such a happy fella!,"Sep 2, 2024","We found the most adorable French Bulldog on the Keystone site, so we contacted the breeder, David Martin.  David allowed me to put a deposit on him by credit card and then held him until I was ready to come pick him up.  Gus (now Winston) is absolutely the cutest, sweetest, smartest, and healthiest puppy we‚Äôve ever had!  We couldn‚Äôt be happier!"
4,Everything we expected!,"Aug 30, 2024","I adopted a puppy from Jacob Speicher on Keystone Puppies, and it was extremely easy, even though I am 9 hours away. He was very helpful, responded quickly even though I had a bunch of questions. Jace showed up healthy and CLEAN. I had him checked by a vet immediately after getting him and they said he was healthy, and looked like he had been cared for very well. We renamed him Paco. He's everything we expected. Highly recommend."
5,Great people  they were very welcoming‚Ä¶,"Aug 7, 2024Verified",Great people  they were very welcoming and answered every question we had.. They also gave us a few things to take with our puppy to keep him as comfortable as possible for the Ling trip home.If we ever are going to get another puppy we will 100% be checking in with them to see if they have or recommend anyone to us.
6,If it wasn‚Äôt for Keystone Puppies I wouldn‚Äôt have my little man,"Updated Aug 3, 2024Verified","If it wasn‚Äôt for Keystone Puppies, we wouldn‚Äôt have met Mel & Ruth Blank. We had a great experience dealing with Mel, great communication every step of the way!!! He made me feel very comfortable, I knew I could trust him. I had been scammed on FB after my 14.5 yr old baby passed away so I was a little nervous. We pulled up to a beautiful, clean home/farm. Kibble (now Oakley) is a gorgeous black & white spoiled cockapoo. He‚Äôs 1 and currently weighing in at 17lbs. Thank you again for a wonderful experience but especially for my adorable baby boyüíô"

We fell in love with his picture, when we met and picked him up there was an instant bond. He is progressing well becoming part of our family!

9,I LOVE MY KEYSTONE PUP‚ù£Ô∏è ,"Jul 23, 2024Verified","I LOVE MY KEYSTONE PUP‚ù£Ô∏è I was nervous to drive 11 hours From Michigan to PA, to get to the location and pick up my pup, because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would even like him but‚Ä¶ MY EXPERIENCE COULDN'T HAVE GONE BETTER! The family that I received him from was wonderful, EXTREMELY supportive and responsive, and created an experience that I won‚Äôt forget. I have since shown my family and friends the website and their specific pups because their facility was clean, well kept, and the dogs at the location were loved and well taken care of.they have even called me to check on him and see how he was adjusting to the change! I was able to meet the parents of my new dog, get a clear representation of how he would look when he aged, and took home a puppy that has thrived since I got him! Thank you for my little Indigo, he is the light of my life and I hope whoever is reading this gets to experience the same thing I did. Thank you Sam! "
10,I do love my puppy!!,"Aug 20, 2024Verified","I do love my puppy!!I have not had alot of experience buying puppies, but I did not care for the way the puppies were housed. They were kept in the top floor of a barn, and I did not notice that they had any air conditioning, that concerns me"
11,Very good website!‚Ä¶,"Jul 23, 2024Verified",Very easy to look at the available puppies for adoption. Easy to reach the breeder. The site gave me the information I needed in order to make my decision. It was easy to meet the breeder and pick up my sweet puppy. We are so blessed to have come across Keystonepuppies.
12,Finding Skittles,"Jun 4, 2024Verified","We had been researching and searching for the perfect puppy for about six months after losing both of our dogs within six months of each other.  When we found your site, I checked it every day.  I was actually obsessed and checked it several times a day.  Of all the puppy adoption sites I looked at, yours was the easiest to navigate.  Your pictures were great and the information, especially about puppy parents was very helpful.  My husband saw our Skittles and fell in love.  I immediately called Omar and Sarah and we made a deposit and picked her up the following weekend.  She is a cuddle bug and we are so happy to have adopted her."
13,We love our new addition to our family,"Jun 18, 2024Verified",We love our new addition to our family.  We named her Rosie. She loves to cuddle and super friendly with everyone.  The explanation of this breed was on target.  Can't say enough about how much we love her already.  Keystone Puppies had a very good reputation so we were very happy and felt confident in our decision to purchase this puppy.      
14,Highly Recommend!,"Jun 7, 2024Verified","We had a great experience with Alvin and his family! He was very responsive to all of our questions, and we were able to meet both of our puppy‚Äôs parents when we picked her up.

My husband and I got our Chocolate lab Bailey through this site almost 8 years ago, then recently adopted her niece, a silver lab we named Pretzel. Bailey has grown to be a beautiful lab, she‚Äôs a big sweet heart in great health. We can‚Äôt wait to see how wonderful Pretzel grows up to be."
16,Wonderful adoption experience,"Feb 29, 2024Verified","We absolutely enjoyed the ease with which we were able to browse the different puppies available in our area.  We used the feature that showed other puppies at a breeder's location to widen our search.  Overall,the site was a little harder to use than Lancaster puppies.. but we chose the Keystone Puppy!  The breeder family we picked was absolutely lovely.   We actually ended up picking a different puppy than the one that we had seen online (although this one was online) because we felt an instant attraction to this one.  The breeder and was helpful, honest, and just a very nice person.  He showed us the puppies parents.  The price was exceptionally fair.  "
17,Sadie was great!,"Feb 21, 2024","Today, I brought my fur baby home and I am beyond pleased with my experience! My breeder name was Sadie, and she was exceptional! Her communication was awesome and she was super accommodating. I drove 2 1/2 and  had some issues finding a bank but she was very understanding and helped figure out an alternate payment method ( Zelle). She even sent me home with some fresh baked cookies that she was baking at the time ! I am beyond grateful!"
18,"Pleasant experience, no complaints","Feb 14, 2024Verified","The breeder was very friendly, informative, honest, and helpful.  We looked at all available cockapoo puppies and my son picked out the female puppy he desired. She has been a wonderful addition to our family.  All puppies seemed to be well cared for and socialized.  Vaccinations were current and documentation was provided.  No complaints, keep up the good work!"
19,We had an amazing experience!,"Jan 6, 2024","We are located out of state, but found the perfect addition to our family on the Keystone Puppies website. We had an amazing experience with Sadie Herschberger. Our puppy Maverick (formerly known as Marz) is well trained on potty pads, so sweet, loving, healthy, and adorable. We also had a great experience with Shawn. He had quick communication and sent us flight updates as Maverick made his way to us. We also got to keep the nice kennel that he was shipped in. Sadie also sent a bag of food, a collar, and the papers with the puppy. Overall, we had an awesome experience!"
